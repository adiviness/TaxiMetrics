# ios app

This is an ios app that communicates with the web api to determine if green or yellow
taxis are cheaper for a specific route.

It's very much a work in progress.

If I had more time to complete it, things I would like to see done include:

- tests
- way to indicate to the user that the app is waiting on data to be received
- preloading of data for boroughs and zones (caching would be nice too)
- better factoring of code into smaller, specialized classes
- better error handling for api call errors
